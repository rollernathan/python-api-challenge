Module 6 Challenge

We were tasked with identifying over 500 random cities at different distances from the equator and analyzing the weather at those different cities with respect to maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

## Maximum Temperature vs Latitude

As indicated in the scatterplot above, the maximum temperature south of the equator (negative values for latitude) increase as we get closer to the equator (zero latitude) and the maximum temperature north of the equator (positive values for latitude) decreases as we get further from the equator. This is in line with what we would expect to be the case. When looking at the data, perhaps it is surprising there is not a greater correlation between maximum temperature and distance from the equator.


## Humidity vs Latitude

As shown in the scatterplot above, there is no correlation between humidity and latitude, or distance from the equator.


## Cloudiness vs Latitude

As shown in the scatterplot above, there is no correlation between cloudiness and latitude, or distance from the equator.


## Wind Speed vs Latitude

As shown in the scatterplot above, there is no correlation between wind speed and latitude, or distance from the equator.




Individual Mouse Analysis
Capomulin_Treatment_of_l509_over_time

Provided above is an example to track the volume of the tumor over time for a specific drug regimen (Capomulin) and mouse (l509). A dynamic analysis can be provided to allow you to explore for any drug and mouse combination upon request.

Weight (Mass) Does Matter
Tumor_Volume_vs_Weight

In performing analysis on the average tumor volume (in cubic millimeters) and the mass (in grams) of the mouse, there appears to be a direct correlation as mass increases, the average tumor volume increases. The correlation between mouse weight (mass) and the average tumor volume is 0.84. This makes sense as the larger the mouse, the larger the tumor.
